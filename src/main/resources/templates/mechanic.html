It&#8217;s a personal favorite of mine, and I&#8217;m excited to see this update. Specialized says it&#8217;s been refined to deliver the most well-rounded, high-performance XC tire you can ride, but we&#8217;ll judge that later.&nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--scaled.webp"><img data-dominant-color="877e70" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--scaled.webp" alt="Roval Control World Cup Wheels Mino knobs" class="not-transparent wp-image-378421" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Mino-knobs--1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></figure> <p>In the meantime, here are the updated tech details.

So our trails haven&#8217;t been very usable, but I was lucky to sneak in a couple of rides, and they were enough to get a glimpse into what the Roval Control World Cup Wheels are all about.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--scaled.webp"><img data-dominant-color="81796c" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--scaled.webp" alt="Roval Control World Cup Whe" class="not-transparent wp-image-378397" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak-hub--1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></figure> <p>My initial ride was to the trails and back, which gave me some nice road time and trail time. First off, the&nbsp;Roval Control World Cup Wheels felt excellent and balanced on the road, and the tires rolled very efficiently. The new tires have a nice round shape, no flattop over exposed side knobs. They felt perfectly paired with the Control World Cup Wheels, as they should. I inflated them to 18/19 PSI to start my journey and felt confident that this pressure would be OK for most of the riding.&nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--scaled.webp"><img data-dominant-color="8a7c6e" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1920" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--scaled.webp" alt="Roval Control World Cup Wheels front hub" class="not-transparent wp-image-378413" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-front-hub--2048x1536.webp 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></figure> <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-on-the-bike">On the Bike</h3> <p>My route to the trailhead is lumpy, riddled with quick climbs that come out of the blue. On these climbs, I could feel the springiness of the Control World Cup Wheels. The lightness adds another dimension to climbing (at least to me). They spin up fast and hold the speed over the terrain, like a nice mid-depth (30mm) road wheel.&nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--scaled.webp"><img data-dominant-color="847d72" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--scaled.webp" alt="Roval Control World Cup Wheels Air Trak" class="not-transparent wp-image-378396" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-Air-Trak--1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></figure> <p>On the trails, everything clicked. The tires and the wheels (the fact that I haven&#8217;t been on the trails that much this season) all felt great. The first impression was, <em>&#8220;These are light,&#8221; </em>and then, <em>&#8220;These are fast.&#8221;</em> Of course, the first impression is the weight, but the second is the tires. The trails were frozen, with some ice and ruts. I could hook up on the trail and rumble over the ruts without feeling squirmy.&nbsp;</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--scaled.webp"><img data-dominant-color="917a63" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--scaled.webp" alt="Roval Control World Cup Wheels top fast trak" class="not-transparent wp-image-378429" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Roval-Control-World-Cup-Wheels-top-fasat-trak--1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a></figure> <p>I mounted the Fast Trak on the front and the Air Trak on the rear, and it was the right move for the conditions.

The wheels will be a true asset to the race and performance-focused riders.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>What about the price?</em> </strong>Well, it&#8217;s about $3/gram for the Control World Cup Wheels at $3,000 per set. Their closest production (big box) competitor is the Bontrager RSL (1200g) at $2,700 and the DT Swiss XRC 1200 (1,300g) at $2,900 for the set.&nbsp;</p> <h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stay-tuned">Stay Tuned</h4> <p>We plan on testing these this season with lots of racing (my hip willing), and we&#8217;ll report back soon. Until then, we can confidently say these wheels are light, fast, and expensive. But it could be worth it if you&#8217;re on a quest for a Stars and Stripes jersey or to build the ultimate XC race rig.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/cycling-gear/bike-parts/bike-wheels?page=1&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=US_Branded_Search_%20Wheels_ROI&amp;utm_id=21317042552&amp;utm_content=162464120359&amp;utm_term=roval%20wheels&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiArKW-BhAzEiwAZhWsICELTElWVIxxVajmhMyZ_mozKB3eUV7W0vQqI_hFIY-9YbUuRWhVuhoCuUsQAvD_BwE">www.Specialized.com</a></p> <p>The post <a href="https://bikerumor.com/review-roval-control-world-cup-wheelset-air-trak-xc-tire/">Roval Releases 992g World Cup Wheelset and Updated XC Tires </a> appeared first on <a href="https://bikerumor.com">Bikerumor</a>.</p>

                nce you find a match &#8211; you stick with it. Specialized&#8217;s Phenom is the go-to saddle for many on and off-road athletes. It was my favorite saddle until the Power saddle arrived on the scene. However, the newly minted Specialized Phenom Pro gives a new twist on an old favorite, making it the newest to receive the Mirror treatment.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black-.webp"><img data-dominant-color="0e0d0e" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black-.webp" alt="Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle press black" class="not-transparent wp-image-378440 first-image" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black-.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black--768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">(Photo: Specialized)</figcaption></figure> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-specialized-phenom-pro-with-mirror">Specialized Phenom Pro with Mirror</h2> <p>We see Specialized add some extra features to their saddles with updates like Elaston and carbon rails, but the most impactful is the Mirror upgrade.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--scaled.webp"><img data-dominant-color="978971" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--scaled.webp" alt="Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle nose" class="not-transparent wp-image-378437" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">(Photo: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure> <p><strong><em>What is Mirror?</em></strong> Mirror technology boasts a 3D-printed matrix with 20,055 struts and 8,735 nodes in the place of traditional padding.</p> <p><em><strong>What does that mean?</strong> </em>It&#8217;s a 3D-printed saddle padding that helps evenly distribute weight over the full saddle, with uniquely designed padded areas that provide more or less support.

The Phenom Pro (hollow-titanium-railed) with Mirror claims to reduce sit bone pressure by up to 28% (most Specialized Mirror saddles boast this claim) while optimizing blood flow and protecting soft tissue. That means less pain, more performance, and more fun.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-.webp"><img data-dominant-color="070707" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-.webp" alt="Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle press" class="not-transparent wp-image-378439" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press--768x432.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">(Photo: Specialized)</figcaption></figure> <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comfort-equals-power">Comfort Equals Power</h3> <p>Designed for maximum rider movement, the Phenom Pro with Mirror measures 27cm long, allowing riders to shift positions without restriction.

As mentioned above, I switched to the Power around 2016 and never looked back. However, preferences change as time passes, and it was good to get back on a Phenom, especially on the mountain bike. When I left the Phenom, the only option was the PU foam Level 2 padding design. It was great at the time, but I remember wanting more of a cradle or perch, and the Power scratched that itch.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting.jpg"><img data-dominant-color="857c7a" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1800" height="1200" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting.jpg" alt="Specialized Project Black S-Works Mirror prototype 3D-printed saddle, Retul fit testing" class="not-transparent wp-image-314331" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-720x480.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/specialized-2023-project-black-prototypes/">Specialized Project Black </a>S-Works Mirror prototype 3D-printed saddle, Retul fit testing.

Calling it their most capable and affordable eMTB yet, the Kado is a full-powered, 150mm travel bike built for trail or enduro riding.</p> <p>The new Kado eMTB lineup includes options for full carbon, carbon/aluminum, or aluminum framed models. The bikes all come equipped with 29” wheels but can be converted to MX setups. Whyte went with Bosch drive systems, employing their newest Performance Line CX motors for all Kado models.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whyte-kado-frame-features-and-specs">Whyte Kado &#8211; Frame Features and Specs</h2> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road.webp"><img data-dominant-color="515038" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road.webp" alt="Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, side, dirt road" class="not-transparent wp-image-378285 first-image" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-side-dirt-road-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> <p>Depending on the model, the Kado features either a full carbon, carbon/aluminum, or aluminum frame. The bikes provide 150mms of rear travel, and all models come with 160mm forks.</p> <p>Whyte equips their bikes with custom-tuned rear shocks, but they didn’t provide details on how exactly the shock is tuned. They do note the Kados are compatible with coil or air shocks. The Kados’ linkages rotate on phosphate-coated bearings packed with marine grease to ensure long-lasting performance. </p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position.webp"><img data-dominant-color="585f46" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position.webp" alt="Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, motor position" class="not-transparent wp-image-378278" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-motor-position-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> <p>A big priority in Whyte’s eMTB frame design is achieving the lowest possible center of gravity. The new Kados’ center of gravity is 12.5mm lower than Whyte’s previous mid-travel E-160 eMTB.</p> <p><em>“By tilting up the motor, we’ve been able to slide the battery towards the bottom bracket and down towards the ground. This lowers the bike’s centre of gravity as much as possible, reduces the effect of the weight, and makes the bike more agile and a lot more fun to ride,” </em>says Sam Shucksmith, Head of Mountain Bike Design for Whyte Bikes. Shucksmith also happens to be the National and Series Champion of the 2024 British E-Enduro racing series. Both titles were won on prototype Kados.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel.webp"><img data-dominant-color="b1b3b2" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel.webp" alt="Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, rear wheel" class="not-transparent wp-image-378286" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-S-rear-wheel-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> <p>All Kado models come with 29” wheels, but they are MX-compatible. Riders can replace the stock &#8220;Shape.It&#8221; links with Whyte’s MX version to fit a 27.5” rear wheel.

The Bosch System Controller in the top tube houses the power button, plus indicates the assist level and battery life. Whyte gives the Kado RSX models a Purion 400 display unit too, so you can easily see your speed or other metrics as you ride.  The drive system offers four assist levels to choose from, including Bosch’s power-regulating eMTB mode. Bosch’s eBike Flow App can be used to customize settings, update software, etc.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender.webp"><img data-dominant-color="61634e" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender.webp" alt="Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, fender" class="not-transparent wp-image-378275" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-eMTB-fender-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> <p>With all those electronic components, it’s reassuring to know Whyte has extensively tested the Kados year-round in wet, muddy U.K. conditions. The Kados include several weatherproofing touches (eg. sealed cable and hose ports) to keep your electronics safe and dry. The battery charge port was also located out of the path of rear wheel spray, and an integrated rear fender helps keep your bike cleaner.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-geometry">Geometry:</h2> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart.webp"><img data-dominant-color="f0f0f0" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="740" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart.webp" alt="Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, geometry chart" class="not-transparent wp-image-378282" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart-297x183.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-geometry-chart-768x474.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> <p>All Kado models are available in S, M, L, and XL frame sizes. The Kado frames include a flip-chip that offers High and Low geometry settings. The Low position slacks out the bike by 0.6° and drops the BB by 8mms.</p> <p>For a quick look at key geo numbers, the Kado’s head tube angles are 64.4° in Low position or 65° in High. Seat mast angles range from 77.5° – 77.9° depending on frame size. Reach on a medium frame is 460mm, while a large measures 485mm. Chainstay length on all frame sizes is 450mm, and BB height is 350mm (High) or 342mm (Low).</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-model-lineup">Model Lineup:</h2> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest.webp"><img data-dominant-color="605f3f" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest.webp" alt="Whyte Bikes Kado eMTB, angle, forest" class="not-transparent wp-image-378283" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-angle-forest-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> <p>As noted above, the top-level RSX models have carbon frames, the mid-spec RS models are carbon front/aluminum rear, and the lower-end S models feature aluminum frames.</p> <p>The AXS-equipped RSX models include one very nice touch – The derailleurs are wired in to get their power from the bike’s main battery. But what if you drain the battery, you ask? Whyte has cleverly wired the derailleur to the battery’s reserve lighting cells, so even if you run out of assist power there’s a little juice left to keep your derailleur working.</p> <p>Weights for all models were not provided, but Whyte says a size medium Kado RSX weighs 24.2 kg/53.35 lbs.</p> <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kado-rsx-8499">Kado RSX: €8499</h3> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side.webp"><img data-dominant-color="c8c9cb" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="709" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side.webp" alt="Whyte Bikes Kado RSX eMTB, side" class="not-transparent wp-image-378284" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side-297x175.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side-120x71.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Whyte-Bikes-Kado-RSX-blue-side-768x454.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> <p>For full build specs on each Kado model visit Whyte Bikes’ website. Here’s a quick rundown of key components: The Kado RSX features a Fox Float X Performance Elite rear shock and a Fox Float 38 Performance Elite fork. It rolls on a pair of DT Swiss Hybrid HT1900 wheels. This model gets a SRAM S1000 AXS derailleur and AXS shift pod. Braking is handled by Magura’s MT7s with 203mm rotors.</p> <p>The RSX model is available in two color options – Gloss Light Silver or Gloss Midnight Blue.</p> <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kado-rs-7299">Kado RS: €7299</h3> <p>*<em>Please note the Kado RS is built with some incoming components from SRAM</em>.<em> We can’t show you a photo just yet!

                er-mythical-performance-w-690-points-of-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Industry Nine launched the Hydra platform</a> six years ago, it was a massive improvement over their Torch platform in terms of engagement. Pre-2020, it seemed that brands were still vying for the top engagement spot and the 690 points of engagement for the Hydra made the industry take notice.</p> <p>If you&#8217;ve ever met the Industry Nine team or had the chance to tour their factory in Asheville, North Carolina, you know that they thrive on precision. And the pursuit of perfection. They claim to have over 100,000 Hydra hubs in global use, and they&#8217;ve taken all of the feedback from riders across the globe to heart.</p> <p>&#8220;Our goal with Hydra2 was to create a hub that could endure the most extreme conditions and the most demanding riders,&#8221; said Jacob McGahey, VP and Head of Product Development at Industry Nine. &#8220;By leveraging lab testing, real-world data, and our in-house engineering and manufacturing resources, we&#8217;ve achieved a hub that sets a new standard.”</p> <p>Just what does &#8220;a new standard&#8221; mean for Industry Nine? It&#8217;s a hub that is better in almost every metric while keeping it within a few grams of the original Hydra. </p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11.webp"><img data-dominant-color="a5aab5" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1536" height="1024" data-id="378313" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-1536x1024.webp" alt="Industry Nine Hydra 2 hub" class="not-transparent wp-image-378313 first-image" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-11-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></a></figure> </figure> <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-key-improvements"><strong>Key improvements:</strong></h3> <ul class="wp-block-list"> <li><strong>Enhanced Axle Strength:</strong>&nbsp;A 65% thicker axle engineered for superior stress dissipation.</li> <li><strong>Increased Bearing Longevity:</strong>&nbsp;Larger 6903 bearings throughout the hub, a new labyrinth channel, and full-contact radial lip seals on the freehub and endcaps for unparalleled protection against contaminants.</li> <li><strong>Consistent Bearing Preload:</strong>&nbsp;A foolproof design maintains peak bearing performance, regardless of axle tightness.</li> <li><strong>Reinforced Pawl Engagement:</strong>&nbsp;Larger 5.5mm pawl pockets, providing 26% improved force dissipation to prevent wear and tear.</li> <li><strong>Improved Drivetrain Durability:</strong>&nbsp;Tougher metal for the drive ring and an additional tooth on each pawl, specifically designed to handle the high torque demands of powerful E-bike motors.</li> </ul> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-scalloped-hubshell">New Scalloped Hubshell</h2> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs4.png"><img data-dominant-color="f2f1f1" data-has-transparency="true" decoding="async" width="987" height="287" data-id="378328" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs4.png" alt="Industry Nine Hydra 2 hub specs" class="has-transparency wp-image-378328" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs4.png 987w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs4-297x86.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs4-120x35.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs4-768x223.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px" /></a></figure> </figure> <p>In an effort to minimize weight while increasing the spoke flange strength, the new hub has a scalloped hubshell.

The new axle is 65% thicker to &#8220;dissipate stress more efficiently.&#8221; That axle now rides inside larger 6903 bearings throughout the hub along with a new labyrinth channel and full-contact radial lip seals to keep the bearings running smoother, longer. </p> <p>In order to prevent variations in axle tightness from affecting the bearing adjustment, a new preload design has been implemented. Industry Nine describes it as follows:</p> <p>&#8220;The first bearing is pressed into the hub shell, sitting flush with both the shell and the axle. The second bearing is pressed onto the axle, sitting flush with the axle but not the shell, causing a slight amount of compression on the axle. Installing the bearings this way creates a slight compression on the axle, which pushes the bearing rings against the balls. This creates a small amount of friction. When the hub is installed in the frame or fork, the clamping force from the mounting system applies pressure to the axle. This&nbsp;counteracts the initial preload, relieving pressure on the bearing rings and allowing them to spin freely with minimal friction.&#8221;</p> <p>This method claims to eliminate overloading of the bearings, and removes the need for additional adjustment mechanisms used on other hubs. </p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-new-freehub">New Freehub</h2> <figure class="wp-block-gallery

The pawl pockets have been reinforced too, with a larger 5.5mm pocket which claims to offer 26% better force dissipation to prevent the pockets from ovalizing after many years of abuse.</p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hydra_drive_headon_nolockring.webp"><img data-dominant-color="959796" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1200" height="1200" data-id="378381" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hydra_drive_headon_nolockring.webp" alt="Hydra 2 drive ring no locking" class="not-transparent wp-image-378381" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hydra_drive_headon_nolockring.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hydra_drive_headon_nolockring-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hydra_drive_headon_nolockring-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hydra_drive_headon_nolockring-768x768.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></a></figure> </figure> <p>Oh, and the engagement is better too.

And the sound? Well, the sound hasn&#8217;t changed much. To our ears it&#8217;s maybe a bit higher pitched, but still the same I9 sound loved by those who also love loud hubs.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-current-hub-lineup">Current Hub Lineup</h2> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-14 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs2.png"><img data-dominant-color="e7ebef" data-has-transparency="true" decoding="async" width="1079" height="554" data-id="378326" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs2.png" alt="Industry Nine Hydra 2 hub specs" class="has-transparency wp-image-378326" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs2.png 1079w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs2-297x152.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs2-120x62.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-specs2-768x394.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px" /></a></figure> <figcaption class="blocks-gallery-caption wp-element-caption">Hydra 2 hub options at launch</figcaption></figure> <p>The Hydra 2 will completely replace the existing Hydra hubs, and it also shifts the line&#8217;s focus to the more aggressive end of mountain biking.

The timing was meant to give us plenty of time to ride and abuse the Hydra 2 hubs and have the review ready to go for the launch.</p> <p>Then the <a href="https://bikerumor.com/?s=asheville" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hurricane hit</a>. </p> <p>It is a testament to the staff at Industry Nine that they were able to not only rally around their community and support them in a historic time of need, but also manage to design, engineer, manufacture, and launch a brand new hub platform while using their headquarters and factory to collect and distribute much-needed donations.</p> <p>Needless to say, the delivery of the wheels got pushed to the very end of 2024, but I&#8217;ve still managed to get quite a few miles on the wheels since then.</p> <figure

to maximize my testing mileage and the amount of abuse I could inflict on them, I intended to put them on an ebike, so I9 sent the Alloy DH System MTN wheels with GR 300 v2 rims. I mounted the wheels to the only full-power Class 1 ebike I have in at the moment, the REI Co-Op DRT e3.1.</p> <p>December started out wet, with closed trails so when the temperature finally dropped low enough to freeze things, it was time to ride. Surprisingly, we actually had a good amount of snow this winter, which quickly changed to ice. It&#8217;s been a terrible winter for fat biking, but it&#8217;s been great for winter ebiking as long as you have some studded tires. </p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-20 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16.webp"><img data-dominant-color="6f777f" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1536" height="864" data-id="378310" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16-1536x864.webp" alt="Industry Nine Hydra 2 on ice" class="not-transparent wp-image-378310" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-16-1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></a></figure> </figure> <p>Mounting up my set of Schwalbe Ice Spiker Pro studded tires proved challenging. The combination of the Grade 300 V2 rim and the Ice Spiker tires was a <em>tight</em> one, which forced me to use tools (and gloves), resulting in one broken Lezyne Power XL tire lever. I got them installed, and airing up the tires was instantaneous, but I&#8217;m not looking forward to wrestling them off. </p> <p>I also had to make a change of rotors since the System wheels only come in 6-bolt, and the bike came with Centerlock rotors. I wanted to upsize the rotors from 180mm to 200mm anyway, so it was a good chance to change. </p> <figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-21 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"> <figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12.webp"><img data-dominant-color="788084" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1536" height="864" data-id="378311" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12-1536x864.webp" alt="Industry Nine Hydra 2 hub review" class="not-transparent wp-image-378311" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Industry-Nine-Hydra-2-hub-ebike-wheelset-review-12-1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px" /></a></figure> </figure> <p>I don&#8217;t have a lot to say about the hubs at this point, other than they roll extremely smoothly and have been doused in mud, salt, snow, and freezing water – including a few dips up to the hubs after breaking through thin ice and really testing the waterproofing of my winter boots. I didn&#8217;t expect to have any issues yet, and I&#8217;m happy to report that I was right. </p> <p>Compared to the other Industry Nine System wheels I&#8217;ve ridden, this pair is noticeably stiffer. That&#8217;s understandable considering they&#8217;re 32 spoke with <a href="https://bikerumor.com/new-industry-nine-hydra-grade-300-v2-wheels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the stiffest rim Industry Nine makes</a>. I&#8217;m a lighter rider who is usually not hard on wheels, so <a href="https://bikerumor.com/review-industry-nine-hydra-equipped-enduro310-carbon-29-mtb-wheels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I have no problem running 24 or 28 spokes </a>usually. However, I9 doesn&#8217;t offer a wheel that is compatible with full-power ebikes with anything less than 32 spokes. My plan in the summer is to throw some tire liners in, and get out and smash it.</p> <p>I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ve had essentially zero issues with Industry Nine wheels over the past decade or more of use. But for those who have broken hubs, the Hydra 2 seems to have improved in every way to deliver a more durable hub. Hubs that will keep your bike rolling with less maintenance.</p> <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"> <iframe class="youtube-player" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmNZxvmyOoI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe> </div></figure> <p><em><a href="https://industrynine.com/technology/hydra2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industrynine.com</a></em></p> <p></p> <p>The post <a href="https://bikerumor.com/industry-nine-hydra-2-hubs-wheelset-review/">New Industry Nine Hydra 2 Hubs are Stronger, More Durable, w/ Less Drag &amp; More Engagement</a> appeared first on <a href="https://bikerumor.com">Bikerumor</a>.</p>

Intense just launched what they&#8217;re calling the <a href="https://intensecycles.com/pages/frame-first-dealer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frame First Program</a>. It&#8217;s an IBD program that&#8217;s geared towards helping the Independent Bicycle Dealers (IBD) with the challenges they&#8217;ve been facing lately. Intense says the program is designed to &#8220;empower the IBD and disrupt the broken industry model&#8221;.</p> <figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"> <iframe class="youtube-player" width="600" height="338" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElNREKT6JNc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe> </div></figure> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-frame-first-program">Frame First Program</h2> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike.webp"><img data-dominant-color="cfcdcc" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1280" height="720" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike.webp" alt="Intense Cycles Frame First Program without bike" class="not-transparent wp-image-378298 first-image" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Intense-Cycles-Frame-First-Program-without-bike-1200x675.webp 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">(Photos / Intense Cycles)</figcaption></figure> <p>It works like this: Intense places the dealer at the center of the bike purchase journey. It&#8217;s there that the dealer can create value for the riders while generating cash flow-positive margins without the inventory risk. Intense will be working with Quality Bicycle Products (QBP) to offer pre-configured build kits for Intense frames. This, in turn, will allow the dealer to provide a customizable experience for their customers while not bearing the heavy inventory burden.</p> <p>It also means that as products change and new ones are introduced, dealers won&#8217;t be stuck with bikes built with old components that consumers no longer want. </p> <p>There will be some exclusive dealer perks as well&#8230;</p> <p><strong>50k Components</strong><br>Dealers will be unlocking a catalog of 50,000 unique components, giving them the power to fine-tune every detail. This can optimize performance and allow them to craft a bike that&#8217;s one of a kind. </p> <p><strong>300 Component Brands</strong><br>There will be 300 renowned and 70 exclusive component brands at the dealer&#8217;s fingertips. The dealer will be able to push familiar favorites or experiment with new combinations. </p> <p><strong>Value</strong><br>With this new dealer-centric business model, building a custom bike doesn&#8217;t have to break the bank, offering customizations at no additional cost.</p> <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-word-from-intense">A Word From Intense</h2> <p>&#8220;<em>We believe strongly that the current bike industry model is broken and that the IBD is the unfortunate recipient of that brokenness,</em>” said Mike Carr, INTENSE Vice President of Sales and Marketing. “<em>The new INTENSE Frame First Program solves some of the biggest challenges that dealers face today while enhancing the value of the IBD to the rider.

This new <a href="https://www.ciclovation.com/GRIND-TOUCH/81820028.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grind Touch_Diamond GXL</a> bar tape is being hawked as &#8220;the ultimate handlebar tape for gravel cyclists&#8221;. But, Cyclovation goes on to say that the new tape is &#8220;<em>designed to deliver control, comfort, and durability on every ride</em>&#8220;. Which sounds like all cyclists could benefit? I&#8217;ll let you guys be the judge.</p> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero.webp"><img data-dominant-color="dfd7d8" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="1280" height="853" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero.webp" alt="Ciclovation Grind Touch_ Diamond GXL Gravel Bar Tape hero" class="not-transparent wp-image-378048 first-image" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">(Photos / Ciclovation)</figcaption></figure> <p>The tape uses &#8220;high-performance&#8221; elastomer composite materials.

The tape material should allow for easy installation and is said to conform effortlessly to a variety of handlebar shapes as well.

                on Thunderflash enduro and Rocket downhill bikes have still managed to fly under the radar for the past few years. But ever since we were fully introduced to these two bikes back in 2021, I&#8217;ve been keeping an eye out for them at trail centers and bikeparks.

Plus, they are quite a small company, so a great option if you are looking to build a unique shredder.</p> <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-new-since-we-last-checked-in">What&#8217;s new since we last checked in?</h3> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH.webp"><img data-dominant-color="52523d" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1333" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH.webp" alt="2025 Prime Thunderflash enduro bike raw carbon updates, new UDH" class="not-transparent wp-image-378258" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike-now-with-UDH-720x480.webp 720w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></figure> <p>Functionally, it&#8217;s just an upgrade to UDH for the 2025 Prime Thunderflash.

In fact, the raw look with a durable glossy clearcoat is now the default finish for all new 2025 complete bike builds and framesets. So it looks like the only way to get one of the unique splatter-paint finishes is with remaining stock of of the outgoing 2024 builds.</p> <h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-2025-prime-thunderflash-amp-rocket-pricing-options-amp-availability">2025 Prime Thunderflash &amp; Rocket &#8211; Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3> <figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike_raw-carbon-complete.webp"><img data-dominant-color="5a5935" data-has-transparency="false" decoding="async" width="2000" height="1200" src="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike_raw-carbon-complete.webp" alt="2025 Prime Thunderflash enduro bike raw carbon complete bike upgraded with UDH" class="not-transparent wp-image-378256" style="" srcset="https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike_raw-carbon-complete.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike_raw-carbon-complete-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike_raw-carbon-complete-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike_raw-carbon-complete-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-Prime-Thunderflash-enduro-bike_raw-carbon-complete-768x461.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a></figure> <p>The newly UDH-equipped Prime Thunderflash comes only with SRAM AXS Eagle Transmission builds, starting at $7500 / 8000€ with GX or a grand more with X0.
