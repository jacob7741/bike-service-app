# bike-service-app

My first java app :-)
\

Feel free to download and explore what I’ve been working on. 
Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome as I continue 
to improve and expand the app.

You can download it from the master branch, which is always kept up-to-date, and see all the features and functionalities I’ve developed. This app is designed for bike shop managers and mechanics to efficiently manage bike service operations.

There is some login and password users, so you can login and chack how it's works:
ueser: johndoe, password: password12

user: janesmith, password: password34
